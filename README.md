# Apigee API Jam Lab Guide

Welcome to Apigee API Jam workshop. This hands-on workshop takes into account the experience of hundreds of customers who have used Apigee Edge to implement a successful API program. By the end of this workshop, you will walk away with practical experience using the Apigee Edge platform, along with an understanding of its comprehensive capabilities.

## Pre-requisites

* **Apigee Account** - If you don’t have an account, sign-up for a trial account at [https://login.apigee.com/sign__up](https://login.apigee.com/sign__up)  We will notify you on the registered email, once the account is created. This could take a few minutes.

* **REST Client** - cUrl or Postman.  If you use Postman, you can import the collection from here - (https://www.getpostman.com/collections/2ad2fcdaf01a2058abb4)
    You can choose to use Postman if you are familiar with it. Or you can use cURL command to invoke the calls.
    If you do not have Postman and want to install it from here: (https://www.getpostman.com/)
    We have a pre built collection which contains all the API calls you will need.
    you can import the collection from here - (https://www.getpostman.com/collections/2ad2fcdaf01a2058abb4)
    If you don't know how to import Collections, please see details here: (https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/data_formats#importing-postman-data)
 

## Lab 1: Import a proxy

### Summary

In this lab, we will import a pre-built API proxy bundle into the Apigee Edge platform. 

### API Proxy Bundle
An API Proxy Bundle is a collection of API Proxy artifacts and policies that represent the configuration of such API Proxy. 

#### Instructions

1. Download the Proxy bundle from the [I Love APIs API Jam repository](https://github.com/sudheesreedhara/Iloveapis-apijam/blob/master/Resources/beers_apiproxy_bundle.zip). Click **Download**.

![image alt text](./images/image_0.png)

2. Go to [https://apigee.com/edge](https://apigee.com/edge) and log in to your new Apigee trial organization. Under your username, select the Organization for which you are an "Organization Administrator"

![image alt text](./images/image_1.png)

3. Navigate the **Develop → API Proxies** on the left side menu, click **+Proxy** in the top right corner to invoke the Create Proxy Wizard. Then select **Proxy Bundle**, and click next. 
![image alt text](./images/image_2.png)

4. You will need to click on the **Choose File** button next to the **ZIP Bundle** option and select the **beers_apiproxy_bundle.zip** from the Github repository you downloaded above. Enter the following details in the proxy wizard and click **Next**, then **Build.**

    * Proxy Name : **Beers**

5. Click on the link to view your API proxy in Proxy Editor. Then click the **Deployment** dropdown, select the **test** environment, then **Deploy** from the **Overview** tab. 
![image alt text](./images/image_3.png)

6. Once your API is deployed successfully, select **Develop** in the right side tab bar menu and the API Proxy configuration view is displayed.

 ### Call loadGenerator API 
Now we are going to call load-generator API to populate some data for Analytics. We will explore more on Analytics in Lab-6. 

NOTE - When you invoke this API, you will only see a `HTTP 200 OK` response.

  *  If you are using **Postman**, then call the loadgenerator API.
  *  If you are using **cUrl**, then
  
  ```curl -v https://{FQDN}/v1/loadgenerator```

NOTE - FQDN stands for fully-qualified domain name. You could find the complete URLs under **Overview** tab of your API proxy.

## Lab 2: Explore policies

### Summary

In this lab, we will explore the various API proxy policies that can be configured in Apigee. 

### Spike Arrest Policy

The Spike Arrest policy protects against traffic spikes. It throttles the number of requests processed by an API proxy and sent to a backend, protecting against performance lags and downtime.

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to the **Target Endpoints** default **Preflow** and highlight the **Spike Arrest** policy. The default **Spike Arrest** rate in the API Proxy is 10pm.
![image alt text](./images/image_4.png)

2. Select **Overview** in the right side tab bar menu and copy the **Beers Deployments URL** for the **test** environment. 

3. Select **Trace** in the right side tab bar menu and the API Proxy configuration view will be displayed. Paste the Beers Proxy URL into the **Send Request URL** section and add a forward slash and number I.E. **/1** Select **Start Trace Session**, then click the **Send** button a few times to trigger the **Spike Arrest** policy. Click on the **Spike Arrest** policy icon in the **Transaction Map** to view the flow details in the **Phase Details** section below. 
![image alt text](./images/image_5.png)

        curl https://{FQDN}/v1/beers/1

### Verify API Key Policy
The Verify API Key policy lets you enforce verification of API keys at runtime, letting only apps with approved API keys access your APIs. This policy ensures that API keys are valid, have not been revoked, and are approved to consume the specific resources associated with your API products. 

**Instructions:**

1. Select **Develop** in the right side tab bar menu. Navigate to the **Proxy Endpoints** default **Preflow** and highlight the **Verify API Key** policy. Change the ‘enabled=**false’** to ‘enabled=**true’**, then click the blue **Save** button.
![image alt text](./images/image_7.png)

2. Select **Trace** in the right side tab bar menu and the API Proxy configuration view is displayed and select **Start Trace Session**. Click the **Send** button in the **Send Request URL** section to trigger the **Verify API Key** policy. You should receive a HTTP 401 error.

        curl https://{FQDN}/v1/beers/1

In the subsequent lab, we will see how to pass the API key to make a successful (HTTP 200) calls.

## Lab 3: Management APIs

### Summary

In this lab, we will see how to use the Apigee management APIs to automate the promotion of API from a lower environment (test) to a higher environment (prod). Copy the following command into an editor and replace {Your-org-Name}, {Your-proxy-name} and {Your-Apigee-Email-Address} before executing. 

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/{Your-org-Name}/e/prod/apis/{Your-proxy-name}/revisions/1/deployments -u {Your-Apigee-Email-Address}
```
NOTE - Don't include `{` or `}` in your command. Here is a sample : 
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded" https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1/o/myorg/e/prod/apis/Beers/revisions/1/deployments -u myname@gmail.com
```

When prompted, enter your Apigee Password.

You should see a success response which looks like this: 
```
{
  "aPIProxy" : "Beers",
  "configuration" : {
    "basePath" : "/",
    "steps" : [ ]
  },
  "environment" : "prod",
  "name" : "1",
  "organization" : "{your_organization}",
  "revision" : "1",
  "server" : [ {
    "status" : "deployed",
    "type" : [ "message-processor" ],
    "uUID" : "71c113ae-7ca7-4001-a727-e9d30764ab59"
  } ... 
  .....
   ],
  "state" : "deployed"
 }
```
*NOTE - Execution time of this command will be a minute or two*

Now if you go back to the Edge UI, you will notice that your Beer proxy is deployed on both test and prod environments. 

![image alt text](./images/image_10.png)

This lab demonstrates how easy it is in Apigee Edge to automate the management activities. These APIs can be scripted or included into automation systems like Jenkins. In fact, all of the capabilities exposed in the management UI, is built upon the Management APIs. Links to Apigee management APIs and related documentation can be found in the References section.

## Lab 4: Publishing the APIs

### Summary

We are going to package our Proxy into a Product, then grant access for an Application to access that Product 

### Define a Product

A Product is a logical grouping of Proxies.  In this section we will create a **BeerCatalog** Product that contains our Proxy.

#### Instructions

1. Navigate to **Publish -> API Products**.

2. Click **+API Product** in the upper right

![image alt text](./images/image_11.png)

3. Name the product **BeerCatalog**.  Set the Environment to **test**, Access to **Public**, and Key Approval to **Automatic**.  Using the **+API Proxy** on the lower right, choose the **Beers** proxy from the dropdown list.  Click **Save**.

## Lab 6: Analytics

### Summary
We are going to  the  traffic in a Custom Report.

### Capture Statistics for Custom Reports

After you’ve generated some traffic, let’s make sure we are capturing the right data from that traffic so we can analyze it via Custom Reports. 


1. Navigate to **Develop -> API Proxies** and choose your proxy.
2. Click on the **Develop** tab in the upper right.  Then click on **GET /:id** under **Proxy Endpoints**.  In the upper pane, you will see the two policies **Statistics Collector** and **Extract Variables** that we’ve already implemented for you in order to capture the "Beer Name" from the JSON response payload.  Take a look at these two policies but don’t change them -- they are used for creating Custom Reports (next step).

![image alt text](./images/image_36.png)

3.   Now click on **Analyze > Reports** in the left pane.  Then click on **+Custom Report**

![image alt text](./images/image_37.png)

4. Fill in the **Report Name**, **Report Description**, and choose **Column** as the **Chart Type**.  Then select **Traffic** in the **Metric** dropdown and choose **Sum** for **Aggregate Function**.  Finally, choose **beer_name** in the **Dimension** dropdown and click **Save** in the lower right.

![image alt text](./images/image_38.png)

5. You should see a report similar to what is shown below.  Please note that it takes 5-10 minutes for API proxy requests to appear in these reports, so your report may need to be refreshed to capture the latest data.  Which beers were the most popular?
